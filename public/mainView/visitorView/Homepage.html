                The series depicts a conflict between singing human-headed toilets—the titular "Skibidi Toilets"—and humanoids with CCTV cameras, speakers, and televisions in place of their heads. The Skibidi Toilets, led by "G-Toilet", overtake humanity. Warfare soon develops between the toilets and the alliance of Cameramen and Speakermen. Each kind of the alliance has a colossal version of themselves, termed "Titans". The Titan Speakerman is infected with a mind-control parasite developed by the toilets' second-in-command and chief strategist, "Scientist Toilet", causing the Titan Speakerman to turn on the alliance. The alliance is expanded to include a species of TV-headed humanoids, and, with their help, Titan Speakerman is eventually cured.
                As the military of both sides continue to advance technologically, the Titans attempt to hunt down G-Toilet. Though their combined powers are occasionally a match for his abilities, his legions intervene each time, allowing him to escape. After a strike mission on the toilets' secret underground laboratory, the Scientist Toilet is finally defeated, but only one member of the team survives, a Cameraman called Plungerman. Having met a mysterious human seemingly involved in the creation of the toilets, the Plungerman is assassinated as a loose end. Meanwhile, fractures between the Skibidi Toilets and the "Astro Toilets", a mysterious splinter faction of powerful extraterrestrial toilets, erupt into violence, and the alliance and Skibidi Toilets enter into a makeshift alliance against their common enemy.
                Skibidi Toilet's audience is predominantly Generation Alpha, those born since the early 2010s. While the series does not appear on YouTube Kids, an app designed for children under 13, it is popular among elementary school students.[1] Kim Kardashian's 11-year-old daughter gave her a necklace reading "Skibidi Toilet".[22] Some members of older generations have called the show "brain rot",[23] while other internet users argue Generation Z had its share of bizarre memes.[24]
                Skibidi Toilet has sparked its audience to create fanworks, such as games, fan fiction, and art,[1] as well as the Generation Alpha slang "skibidi", which has no established definition.[25] The series has found its way into internet memes and Instagram videos.[1] One TikTok meme nonsensically swaps some words in song lyrics with Generation Alpha slang, including skibidi, for humorous effect.[26] Viral videos have surfaced where children sit inside containers and mimic the toilets.[1]
